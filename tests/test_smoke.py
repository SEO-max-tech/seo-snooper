"""Offline smoke tests — NO network, NO credentials. One test class per
module, built milestone by milestone. Fixtures live in tests/fixtures/:
  - sitemap_index.xml, sitemap_blog.xml  (M1: index handling + filters)
  - competitor_page.html                  (M3: title/h1/meta extraction)
  - murf_guide.html                       (M3: h1 + h2/h3 segment extraction)

Mock patterns (match the seo-agents repo):
  - supabase: minimal fake exposing .table().upsert/.select with canned data
  - anthropic: lambda/stub client returning fixed JSON (and one malformed
    response to exercise the retry path)
  - ahrefs: StubProvider directly

Must-have assertions:
  - diff first-run guard returns [] and writes status='baseline'
  - gap buckets at sim 0.70 / 0.80 / 0.90 -> gap / partial / covered
  - judge fail-open on double malformed JSON
  - notify.build_card puts sub-min_volume items in footer, not main list
